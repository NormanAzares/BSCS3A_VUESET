# VueSet

Vueset, a component library developed by the VueSet group, is designed to assist you in creating visually appealing web applications without the need for complex packages or large bundle sizes. Our library offers lightweight and customizable components that cater to the common needs of web developers. Rather than aiming to provide an exhaustive collection of components, our objective is to offer a solution that covers the majority of your component requirements, while still allowing you the freedom to develop more context-specific components as needed.

This project has been undertaken by the VueSet group as a requirement for the BSCS3A-CS202 class, serving as our semestral project.

Feel free to utilize Vueset as a starting point for your own component development. We have prioritized performance and simplicity in our configuration approach.
